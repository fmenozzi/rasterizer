COMP 770 - PA2
==============

This assignment has four parts, as described in pa2.pdf:
    * Rasterization
    * Rasterization + Flat Shading
    * Rasterization + Gouraud Shading
    * Rasterization + Phong Shading

I have provided a Makefile which can be used to build and render images either
individually or all at once. Note that I have only tested this code with g++ 4.8
on Ubuntu 14.04.

There are two ways to render the images:
    1. Using OpenGL and GLUT
    2. Writing .ppm files to disk
